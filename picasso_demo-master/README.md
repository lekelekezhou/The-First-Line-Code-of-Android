# Picasso Demo

This repository contains the source code for my Picasso introduction, which is the 3rd installment of my [_Code Mode Efficiently Series_](http://www.mahram.ca/code-more-efficiently "Code Mode Efficiently")

***This demo is currently a work in progress. Slides and URL will be published when finalized.***

To run the demo, build using Android Studio and run as you would any other Android Project.

Comments and feedback are always welcome.
